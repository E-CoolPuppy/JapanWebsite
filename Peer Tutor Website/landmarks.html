    <p> At 3,778 meters high, Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan. It is considered an active volcano,<br> although it has not erupted since 1707. A symbol of Japanese culture, it has been recreated in art and<br> literature throughout history. Today, people continue to revere Mount Fuji, whether through the shrines<br> that surround it or climbing to the top, which is believed to be “purification” since hundreds of years ago.<br> All in all, along with the Fuji Five Lakes that surround it, Mount Fuji is an amazing sight to see for<br> everyone.</p>

    <p>Located in southern Kyoto, the Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of the most significant<br> Shinto shrines. It is made up of thousands of tori gates, which leads to a trail that<br> goes into the massive forest behind the shrine. Inside the forest lies Mount Inari,<br> a 233 meter-high mountain. Throughout the shrine are numerous fox statues, as<br> the shrine is dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Additionally, at the shrine’s<br> entrance is the Romon gate, which was donated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,<br> and still stands today.</p>

    <p>Since the 1950s, people have been wandering into the forest, known as “the perfect place<br> to die”. In 2003, a catastrophic number of 105 bodies were discovered. Today, signs can<br> be seen throughout the area, pleading any that enter with suicidal thoughts to reconsider.<br> In hopes of not attracting any more potential suicides, Japanese authorities have stopped<br> publishing the exact numbers of those discovered in the forest. </p>

    <p>One of the most famous landmarks of Tokyo is Tokyo Tower, a 333 meter-high<br> tower that stands as the world’s tallest, self-supported steel tower, even besting<br> the Eiffel Tower by 13 meters! It was built in 1958 to represent Japan’s economic<br> success and revival after surviving war. It also serves as a broadcast antenna for<br> the city. Although the completion of the Tokyo Skytree in 2012 bested the tower’s<br> height at a staggering 634 meters, the tower remains an important landmark<br> today.</p>
